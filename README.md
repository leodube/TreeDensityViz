# [Tree Planting Density - Visualization](https://leodube-treedensity-viz.netlify.app)
## Introduction
Tree planters are required to plant their trees in different densities depending on the specifications provided by the client. At each density, the tree planter will be required to change how far they space off of previously planted trees. Tree checkers will make sure the planter has done a good job by throwing a plot, usually an 4m radius circle in which they count the number of trees present. The chart below shows the distance a tree planter must space off of a planted tree to meet the specifications. While uniform spacing will meet the criteria, planters tend to plant in straight lines. A more efficient planter might plant trees slightly closer together along that line, and then space further off of a previous line to compensate. This tool allows the user to try different spacing distances and how it affects quality.
